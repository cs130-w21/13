# How to start up this server
`cd server` ==> make sure that path ends with `13\server`, or `13/server` on UNIX
`npm install`
`npm start`

# Multiplayer Development Instructions
1. In Unity, use [ParallelSync](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync/tree/1.4.1) to run two different clients with Debug at once
    - If confused what it does, watch 4 minute video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r-hwXPJIMo&ab_channel=JasonWeimann, to understand
    - On top bar in Unity, go to ParallelSync > Clones Manager > Add new clone > Open in New Editor

## Server prep
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` everytime you want to reset the game (will be changed in future)
    - In VSCode, you can [have a terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) as part of the screen so that you don't have to have a thousand tabs
4. Checkout index.ts for the socket code
    - (may possibly add other files in future)
5. Modify index.ts
    - (or add new ts files and import them in the index.ts file!)

## Client Prep
6. Checkout Asset/Scripts/RemoteController script for client socket info (and change if you'd like)
7. Run scene "Sockets" in both Unity's and check out Console for debug info
    - Currently, RemoteController.cs is attached to the RemoteController GameObject

## Update Documentation
8. From `13\server`, run `npx typedoc --out ..\docs\server-docs index.ts server.ts`
    - On UNIX, `npx typedoc --out ../docs/server-docs *.ts`.
    - Autogenerated documentation should appear in `13\docs\server-docs`.

## Run Tests
9. From `13\server`, run `npx ts-mocha tests\*.test.ts`.
    - `npm test` works, but only on UNIX due to the backslash issue.

WARNING: when debugging, I highly highly recommend stopping both Unity clients AND the server between each test. Unity networking is kind of wonky + also if you don't stop it, your computer might become super slow (running 2 Unitys) + how server is set up right now.

Note: Unity clients often connect and disconnect (dw it's normal). We can live with it, or we can figure out fixes/optimizations in future.
